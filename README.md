# Document Chatbot

## Overview

This project implements a chatbot that can answer user queries based on the content of uploaded documents. It uses Cohere's API for natural language understanding and LangChain for processing and querying document contents. The chatbot also includes a conversational form that collects user information (Name, Phone Number, Email) when the user requests a call.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Upload and process documents in PDF, CSV, Excel, and text formats.
- **Query Handling**: Ask questions about the content of the uploaded documents and receive answers.
- **Call Request**: If the user requests a call, a form is presented to collect contact details.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **LangChain**: For document processing and querying.
- **Cohere**: For generating responses based on document content.
- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
